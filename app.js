/*  ************* THE "DOM" EXPLAINED *********************
***********************************************************
***********************************************************

>>>>>>>>>>>> SHORT 
> HTML content is stored in the DOM. 

> The DOM is an interface that allows JS to interact with the webpage (HTML code). 

> JS interacts with the DOM using special methods (DOM methods).

-------------------------------------------
WHAT IS DOM MANIPULATON? 
-------------------------------------------
> DOM manipulation simply refers to getting JS code to interact with the browser (HTML)

-------------------------------------------
WHAT IS THE DOM (Document Object Model)? 
-------------------------------------------
> Used to connect webpages to scripts such as JAVASCRIPT

> Is a structured representation of a HTML document

> Structure refers to the structure of a HTML Doc, like: 
(<body> ... </body>, <p> ... </p> etc, etc, .....)

> Think of each HTML tag/element as a box. 
> & boxes within other boxes, example: (link tag inside of a paragraph tag)

> So.. the DOM gives me a fully OBJECT ORIENTATED representation of a HTML doc.

> For each of these boxes the DOM has an OBJECT for it.
> I can then access these DOM objects from my JS code.

> THIS IS HOW PARTS OF A HTML PAGE CAN GET FUNCTIONALITY AND MOVE AROUND LIKE ALL THE COOL EFFECTS I SEE. (particles.js)

***IMPORTANT NOTE:***
> Dont mix up the DOM and JS. They are two different things.

> Think of DOM as a languange translator to allow JS & HTML to talk to eachother. 

> He translates JS lang for HTML so that HTML can understand and RESPOND....

> JS USES SPECIAL METHODS to change DOM objects. (and therefore the webpage itself). 

> These methods are just like methods in normal JS (A function attached to an object literal), but instead.. the object they are attached to is the DOM.

/*  ************* BROWSER GAME - PIG *********************
***********************************************************
***********************************************************
/*
Goal of the game:
- First to get a global score of 100 wins.

GAME RULES:

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he wishes. Each result gets added to his ROUND score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game

BASICALLY THE SAME AS BLACKJACK - but with dice:
- if a '1' is rolled the score is a bust.
- can 'hold' where you skip your turn.
