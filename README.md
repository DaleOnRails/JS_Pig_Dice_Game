# JavaScript PIG Dice Game

## How To Play

**Goal of the game:**

- First to get a global score of 100 wins.

**Game Rules:**

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he wishes. Each result gets added to his **round** score.
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, It's a bust & his entire **round** score is wiped! After that, it's the next player's turn.
- The player can choose to 'Hold' however, which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After which, it's the next player's turn.
- The first player to reach a global score of 100 points wins the game!!!

**To summarize, it's basically the same as blackjack - but with dice:**

- If a '1' is rolled the score is a bust.
- Can 'hold' to play it safe and skip your turn.
- Rather then closest to 21, it's first to reach 100

**GOOD LUCK!**
