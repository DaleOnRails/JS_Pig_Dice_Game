**Changing Game Modes**

*By default the 'hard mode' script is pre-loaded*
- The code has three different scripts for three different game modes.
- Standard Mode (app.js), Hard Mode (hard_mode.js) & Double Dice Mode (double_dice_mode.js).
- To change the game mode you only need to specify which script to load in the HTML.

## How To Play - Standard Mode
*Input field for creating a custom final score is disabled in standard mode*

**Goal of the game:**
- First to get a global score of 100 wins.

**Game Rules:**
- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he wishes. Each result gets added to his **round** score.
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, It's a bust & his entire **round** score is wiped! After that, it's the next player's turn.
- The player can choose to 'Hold' however, which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After which, it's the next player's turn.
- The first player to reach a global score of 100 points wins the game!!!

*Once a player reaches the winning score the game will end & the 'New Game' button at the top must be clicked to play again!*

## Hard Mode

**Exact same as standard mode except for one extra rule:**
- If two 6's are rolled in a row the player loses not just his current round score but his ENTIRE accumulated score
- Hard Mode also features a 'final score' input box where players can choose a custom winning score rather then the default winning score of 100.

**DON'T GET TO GREEDY!** :o

## DOUBLE DICE MODE

- Exact same as standard mode except there are now two dices. If ONE of them rolls a 1, the player loses his current round score.
- Also has custom winning score feature **enabled.**

**GOOD LUCK!** :)
